# GRAPHY_PLOTTER
This repository contains my mini-project, a streamlit app that lets you insert equations in the form of string and shows it on the graph. Purpose of this mini project was to create a tool that can plot as many equations user wants to analyze their behaviour with respect to each other.

#### Following are the screenshots of my streamlit app:
